        <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
        <p>
            Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects individuals in varying degrees of severity. Characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication challenges, and repetitive behaviors, autism impacts how a person perceives and interacts with the world. These challenges can manifest in subtle or profound ways, and no two individuals with autism experience it in the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exact causes of autism remain elusive, though research suggests that it arises from a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Early signs of autism often emerge in childhood, such as limited eye contact, delayed speech, or difficulty in understanding social cues. However, early intervention with therapies tailored to the individual’s needs—such as speech, occupational, and behavioral therapies—has proven to be highly effective in fostering development and independence.

        <p>
            While autism is often viewed through the lens of its challenges, it is equally important to recognize the strengths and unique abilities of individuals on the spectrum. Many exhibit remarkable skills, including heightened attention to detail, exceptional memory, or deep expertise in specific areas of interest. An inclusive society that values these strengths, while offering necessary accommodations, paves the way for individuals with autism to thrive and make meaningful contributions.
